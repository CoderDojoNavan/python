"""1: Hello World"""

# This application will print simple 'Hello World' on the screen.

# Whenever you see a # at the beginning of a line, it means its a comment,
# and nothing here will actually be ran. Watch - this will not be shown when
# you run the program:
#   print('I have no idea how to write python').
# Comments can be used to give yourself instructions for the future, explaining
# how something works, or to temporarly disable code if you are just testing
# something out.

# At the top of the screen we also see a special type of comment, which is
# used to comment files, classes, methods and functions. Don't worry if you
# don't know what it is, we will cover everything :)

# Below is a simple command to print something on the screen. Try running this
# file with
#   python 1-hello_world.py
# (Make sure you are in the basics folder)

print('Hello World')
